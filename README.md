### List of supported features(parser):
- Arithmetic expressions
- Variables
- Conditionals
- Loops
-Functions

### List of supported features(compiler):
- Arithmetic expressions
- Variables
- Conditionals
- Loops


### Building
To build the project you should have `flex`, `bison` ,and `make` installed on a `linux` machine.
Run make to build the project.
```
make
```

(To build the parser alone you should `checkout` to the `parser` branch and run `make`)

### Parser
To test the parser on its own.
After doing a build.
`./parser parser_tests/functions.js`

### Compiler
To test the compiler.
After doing a build.
`./compiler compiler_test/variable1-0.js`
The result should be in the `out.js.asm` file


### Still to do
- Dynamic types
- Add parsing to process syntactic sugar (`for loop` , `arrow functions` )
- Functions
- Hosting
- Objects
- Exceptions

## Generation AST


The data structure used for the generation of AST is a tree whose each node points to its child (chils) and its siblings (next)
the choice of this tree is in relation to the instructions which can have several branches, we have tried to generalize it so that it is generated by any instruction

example :

the for loop:

its grammar: `for(expression;expression;expression){ program } `

the tree generated is a quinary tree.

the conditional if statement:

`if (expression) { program }`

the tree generated is binary.
